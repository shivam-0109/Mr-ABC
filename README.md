# Mr-ABC

Mr. ABC was recently learning about computer division. Considering the basic model of the

computer suppose we wish to divide a number X by D i.e X/D and obtain the result (Note that

it is integer division i.e result of 7/2 will be 3).

Now the computer will give the divide overflow error if:

The number of bits in the binary representation(without appending any leading zeroes) of the

resulting number(quotient) is greater than the number of bits in the binary representation of

divisor(D) (Without appending any leading zeroes).

Now Mr. ABC is given an integer X for T testcases. He wishes to find number of such

divisors D(1<=D<=X) for which divide overflow will not occur
